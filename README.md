This repository contains all of the code related to controlling the underlying merch hardware (the vending machine).
Merch runs an embedded webserver that can be accessed at merch.acm.illinois.edu.

## API

Every request through the API has a token in the header that is unique to groot.
This way, only groot can make requests to vend things.
The token is stored in the request header.

### Vend a location
To vend a list of items, POST a request to `/vend`.
The request is of the form
```json
{
    "transaction_id": 1,
    "items": ["A1", "B2", "C3"]
}
```

The machine will respond with
```json
{
    "transaction_id": 1,
    "items": [
        {"location": "A1", "error": null},
        {"location": "B2", "error": "some sort of error"},
        {"location": "C3", "error": null},

    ]
}
```

The errors that can take place while vending are currently:
* `"Invalid location"`
